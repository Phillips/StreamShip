## StreamShip :boat:
StreamShip is a streaming site aggregator that includes the IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic score for movies that are available. StreamShip will take you directly to the movie that you want to watch on the available streaming site. 

## Web Scraping
Written in Python the movie data was scraped off of various streaming sites. A majority of streaming services have public websites that allow you to see what movies are available without having a subscription ex [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/34399).

## Backend
StreamShip uses a [GraphQL](graphql.org) API that was built on a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database, shout out to [Hasura](https://hasura.io/):pray:.
